# clearcase_process_perl
Scripts I wrote to implement a task-based software configuration management process for use with IBM ClearCase.  These scripts are the property of my previous employer and are presented here as demonstration of my skills and abilities.  These scripts also depend on a module that I wrote that is not presented here.  This is to prevent the scripts from being modified and used commercially.  I will be happy to show the module upon request.
